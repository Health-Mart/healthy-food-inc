I usually boil my chicken breasts for 15-20 minutes until the juices run clear when cut into, then cube them. For the sausage, slice it into bite sized pieces and boil for 10 minutes. Set aside after cooking to use later with the gumbo.The roux is the most important part of a gumbo. If you don't get the roux right, you are probably not going to like your gumbo. There are many recipes you can try for a roux, but this is probably going to be one of the best you have ever had if you are a true gumbo fan. \nLet's get start making the gumbo.Over medium heat in a large pot, add your olive oil. Allow to warm for a minute, and then add in the flour. Stir constantly until all of the flour has disolved and the mixture has a lot of tiny bubbles. Once you have reached that consistency it's time to add in your garlic powder. Allow to bubble, constantly stirring for one minute.Gradually stir in the chicken broth and the beer, stirring constantly until the mixture comes to a slow simmer. \nAdd the celery, all tomatoes, onion, bell pepper, parsley, and cajun seasoning. Reduce heat to a slow simmer, cover, and continue to simmer for 40 minutes, stirring often.\nMix the chicken and sausage into the roux mixture, cover, and cook for an additional 20 minutes, stirring often.Once finished, serve over rice and with a side of french bread.

And a little spicy.\nCut the sausages at the joints.Squeeze the fresh sausage meat out of their casings into a bowl and discard the casings.\nAdd 2 tablespoons of grated parmesan cheese to the sausage meat.If you are using plain sausages, add 2 to 3 teaspoons of Cajun seasonings at this point.

Keep them frozen till they are ready to use.When they are thawed but still very cold, brush the sheets of pastry with melted butter.\nPlace each roll of meat on each sheet.\nRoll the pastry sheet over the meat.

Strain well, pressing out excess water.\nNOTE: I am a big fan of searing meat, because I think it gives sauces a deeper flavor. While the original recipe didn't say to do this-- I plan to sear the pork in some olive oil and then to continue with cooking the onion and garlic and carrying on with the rest of the steps.\nMelt butter in a 5-quart casserole; add the onions. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally until lightly colored, 6 to 8 minutes.\n\nAdd the garlic, season with salt and cook a minute or two longer.\nStir in paprika, pour in 1/2 cup of broth and bring to boil.\n\nAdd the pork cubes. \nSpread sauerkraut over pork sprinkle with caraway seeds. \nCombine tomato puree, tomato paste and reserved broth, in a small bowl. \nMix well and pour over sauerkraut. Bring to a boil.\nIf using a crock-pot, transfer contents of casserole to crock-pot insert. Cover, and cook on high, for 3 to 3-1/2 hours, or until pork is fork tender but still retains its shape.\nIf using a conventional oven, preheat to 250 degrees F. Cover casserole and transfer to the oven. Cook, covered, for 3 to 3-1/2 hours, or until pork cubes are tender but still retain their shape.\nWhen the pork is tender, transfer meat and sauerkraut to a serving platter with high sides. Tent with foil to keep warm.\n\nTransfer the sauce to a 2-quart pan. Set over medium heat. \nCombine flour, heavy cream and sour cream in a small bowl. \nWhisk until smooth. Stir mixture into sauce and simmer for 10 minutes longer. Do not boil. Season to taste with salt and pepper. \nPour over meat and serve. Pass additional sour cream as a side.\nNOTES: I added 2 Tablespoons of tomato paste to this recipe, which we thought gave the sauce deep depth of flavor. We also served this over creamy mashed potatoes.
