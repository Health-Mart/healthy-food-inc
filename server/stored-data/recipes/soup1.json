If you are using raw chorizo you may wish to give it a little bit more time here.  Remember though, it will have enough time to cook through later.\nAdd the thyme, tomato pure, paprika powder and lentils.  Stir the lentils though and then add the stock.\nAdd a little bit of salt and some black pepper.  Cover your soup and allow it to simmer gently for about 20 minutes or until the lentils are cooked and softened to your taste.Check for seasoning and serve.",

Chop the meat into bite-sized pieces.\nAdd the water, chicken broth, salt, pepper, bay leaf, thyme sprigs and the bones from the Diestel turkey thighs to the pot.  Bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to low and simmer 30 minutes.Check the lentils to see level of doneness  they should be soft, but should maintain their shape.  Allow soup to cook an additional 15 minutes so that the lentils can sop up more liquid.10 minutes before serving the soup, add the chopped meat. Remember it is smoked so it is already cooked all the way through  we are simply heating it up.When lentils are fully cooked and the flavors have come together, remove the thigh bone, bay leaf, thyme sprigs and serve in large heaping bowls.Grate desired amount of parmigiano reggiano on top and enjoy!",

Cook with the lid just slightly off the pan, for about 15-20 minutes or until the lentils are almost tender.\nMeanwhile, if you're using bacon (or pancetta), add it to a saute pan and cook over medium-high heat until done. When cooled, crumble the bacon into small pieces and set aside.\nIn a large, deep saute pan over low-to-medium heat, add the olive oil. When hot, add the onion, carrots, garlic and celery and cook until almost soft. \nAdd the tomato sauce, parsley, cream of mushroom or celery soup, 3 cups of water, and salt & pepper to taste. Bring to a boil. Once boiling, add the pasta, lower the heat and cook until the pasta is tender.\n\nDrain your lentils when they're almost soft and add them to the pasta and cook, uncovered, for another 10-15 minutes until they're soft. \nAdd the red pepper flakes and adjust the seasonings to your taste. If you think your soup should be a bit creamier, make a roux (I used 1 tablespoon butter and 1 tablespoon flour and that was sufficient) and slowly whisk it into the lentil and pasta mixture and make sure it's incorporated into the soup. If you like it thinner, add a bit more water. \nAdd your bacon or pancetta if your using it and mix it into the soup.\nWhen you're ready to serve, add to individual bowls and sprinkle with fresh grated Romano cheese.",

                            "step": "* Note: Although this is an easy, straightforward recipe, be sure to use the ham hock or ham bone. I have tested this soup without it and find that without the bone and the meat, it is not really worth making. If you cannot find a smoked ham hock (usually found in the freezer section) and you do not have any cooked ham available, use bone-in smoked ham. (If you want a really meaty soup, use 2 pounds instead of 1.)Cook the bacon in 6-quart stock pot or Dutch oven and drain on paper towels. \nRemove all but 1 tablespoon of bacon fat and then add the olive oil and butter. Over medium heat, cook until foam subsides and then add the onion and cook over medium-low heat, stirring frequently for 15 to 20 minutes until onions are dark brown and have caramelized.\nAdd the garlic, celery and carrots and cook, stirring frequently, for 5 minutes or until carrots have softened. \nAdd the remaining ingredients except the salt and pepper and bring to a simmer over high heat. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer gently for about 1 1/2 hours, until peas fall apart and soup is thick.\nRemove and discard the bay leaf. \nRemove the ham bones, trim off any meat, and return the meat to the pot, discarding the bones. \nWhisk soup until smooth. Taste and adjust seasonings. (The ham is salty and therefore it is unlikely you will need to add salt.) Crumble bacon and sprinkle on individual servings.This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.",

(Be sure to watch closely to ensure it doesnt get too burnt.) \nRemove from oven, place in a bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Once cool, remove skin, seeds and dice flesh into small pieces.\n\nHeat oil and butter over medium heat in a large pot. Cook carrots, onions, and celery for about 4 minutes, then add in cabbage, fennel, bell pepper, and garlic. Cook vegetables for an additional 6 minutes, or until they begin to become soft, mixing occasionally.\nStir in ham meat, bone and peas and cook for an additional 2 minutes. Then pour enough broth to cover the mixture a few inches. Bring to a light simmer, cover pot and reduce heat to low.\nCook for 50-55 minutes, or until peas begin to fall apart. \nRemove from heat. Discard bones and any extra fat. \nMix in cheese, then stir in cayenne, salt and pepper to taste.",

No colour is needed on the vegetables, so make sure the heat isnt too high that they become brown, but high enough the vegetables sweat and soften.\nAdd the tomato pure and  the thyme leaves, stir through and cook for about 30 seconds.\nAdd the stock, the tin of tomatoes, fresh tomatoes, and a little salt and pepper. Stir everything through, set the heat so that your soup is on a gentle simmer, cover and cook for about 25 minutes or until the vegetables are cooked al dente.\nAdd the pasta and cook until the pasta is ready.  Follow the timing instructions on the packet, but this is normally about 7 minutes.\nAdd the cabbage and the beans and cook until the cabbage has wilted.  This will take about 5 minutes.Check for seasoning and add some salt and pepper if needed before serving.\nSprinkle a little parmesan over each bowl of soup.",

To properly clean a leek remove the roots and the dark green ends, so just the white and light green part remains. Slice the leek length wise, halfway through, so all of its layers are visible. Rinse under cold water carefully pulling back layers to remove the sand. Shake off excess water and slice into thin discs.In a large pot or dutch oven, melt butter over medium high heat. Saut leeks, onions and garlic for roughly 3-5 minutes until tender. Do not brown the leeks as it will give your soup a burnt flavour.\nAdd potatoes, carrots, and celery. Cook for an additional 5 minutes stirring frequently. \nSprinkle with parsley, thyme, red pepper flakes, and rosemary, stir to combine. \nPour in chicken broth and season with Worcestershire sauce.Bring soup to a boil and cook for about 5 minutes. Reduce heat, cover and simmer for 25-35 minutes. \nRemove from heat.Using a blender, puree soup in batches until smooth. Salt and pepper to taste.",

Stir, put on lid, and simmer for about 20 minutes or until the lentils are tender.\n\nAdd fresh lemon juice, 2 additional cups of broth and 1/2 cup of rice. Simmer until the rice is tender. The time will vary based on the variety of rice.\nFeel free to the remaining liquid, more if necessary, until the soup is the consistency desired.\nI added two additional cups of liquid after the soup was done cooking so it was too thick. In an effort to reduce sodium I purchase the lowest sodium chicken broth and use about two cups of water. If the soup seems to need additional flavor or salt I add chicken bouillon to taste.\n\nServe with chopped cilantro and sumac.",

Stir in the pasta and cook until tender according to the package instructions  about 10 minutes depending on the type of pasta used. Stir often. \nDrain, reserving the cooking liquid, and rinse the pasta in cold water. Set aside.\nHeat the oil over medium heat in a medium or large saucepan. When hot, add the onion to the pot and saut for 5 minutes or until softened. \nAdd the carrot and saut for another few minutes. Now add the garlic and chilies, and continue to saut for another minute.\nAdd the cumin, coriander, turmeric and amchoor powder if using, stir for another minute, and then add the tomato. Simmer for a few minutes and then add the herbs and 1 1/4 cups of the reserved pasta cooking liquid. Simmer for another few minutes and then add the peas. Simmer for another 3 to 4 minutes, and then add the chickpeas and pasta. Simmer for another 5 to 7 minutes, adding more water if necessary to achieve desired consistency. Season with salt and pepper and serve with crusty bread or just as is. It's wonderful served at room temperature or slightly warmed. I sprinkled the bowl with some nutritional yeast, but feel free to sprinkle some fresh grated Parmesan overtop if you enjoy cheese.",

I know not everyone adds potatoes to their chicken soup, but I was craving something a little more hearty.  The lemon and ginger make the broth beautifully fragrant.  Also, the soup can be served the same day the stock is made.  I like making the stock a day before making the soup because it makes the soup much more flavorful.",

Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer until chicken is cooked through, about 5 minutes.While the chicken cooks, start the noodles following the package instructions. Udon, soba, or vermicelli will all work. Rinse, drain and set aside.Taste the broth and adjust seasonings with salt.Divide noodles into large soup bowls. Store noodles separately for leftovers.When ready to serve, ladle hot broth over noodles.Top with cilantro, scallions and fried shallots.\nServe with a squeeze of lime and additional chili sauce.",

Cook for one more minute\n\nAdd the tomato and after two more minutes, the chestnuts. Stir.\n\nAdd the saffron infused liquid and the water and simmer for 10 minutes.\n\nRemove from heat and mash (I use my blender on a stick but you could also use a potato masher) until the soup is nearly smooth but still has a bit of texture.

Bring to a boil and them simmer on low for 30 minutes.  Once the broth is done simmering you will want to strain it through some cheese cloth.  The lemongrass stalks are not edible, I found that out the hard way.\nBring the broth back to a simmer and add the tofu, mushrooms, snow peas and the rice noodles.\nYou can add the lime juice at any time.\nI added some lime juice at the beginning and then some at the end before serving.\nSimmer until the noodles are soft.\n\nGarnish with grated ginger or scallions.",

Be very careful: you must leave the center cap of the blender off so you do not trap the steam (cover loosely with a towel).\n\nPour into a 1 gallon sauce pot and keep warm.\nReserve and repeat until all the squash has been pureed.\nAdjust to desired consistency with the remaining cooking liquid. Season with salt and pepper.\nTo serve, ladle the hot soup into the individual soup bowls and top with a dollop of Chavrie Goat Cheese Pyramid garnish with fresh herbs.",

Return the soaked beans to the pot and cover with 3 inches of water again, bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium low, put the cover on and allow to cook until the beans start to get tender but still firm, about 1 1/2 hours. \nDrain the beans.\nHeat the oil in a soup pot over med-high heat. \nAdd the onion along with a pinch of salt and saute until softened and golden. Stir in 1 tbsp of ground cumin, add the beans along with the broth or water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover and cook for 30 min. Meanwhile peel and chop the sweet potatoes. Wash the kale, remove the stems and chop the leaves.\nRemove half of the beans and liquid and set aside to cool a bit. \nAdd the sweet potatoes and kale to the pot with some salt and pepper. Cover and cook for 10 minutes. \nTransfer the cooled beans to a blender and puree until smooth, then return them to the pot. Stir in the remaining 1 tbsp of ground cumin. Now add 1 tbsp of the chipotles in adobo. Taste and continue to add more until it has a spice level that you like. Adjust the salt &amp; pepper as needed.\nServe with a dollop of sour cream.",

Set them in the oven for 20-30 minutes till nicely roasted.\nIn a large pot on high, render the bacon and onion till bacon is nicely crisp and onion is translucent. \nAdd the sprinkling of red pepper and garlic, followed by the beef and sausage, breaking up with a large spatula. I chose not to break mine up too much as I liked the larger bits of meat.  Turn and coat the meat with the onions and bacon till browned but not cooked through. As meat begins to brown, add the wine, I like to let the wine cook and bubble for about a minute to evaporate a bit. Next, add the lentils, carrots, beef stock, water and parmigiano rind. Cover the pot and set to a low simmer for 40 minutes (stirring every 10 minutes). Lastly, add the mushrooms, swiss chard, spinach and arugula. Stir and get ready to enjoy!\nI like to serve mine with a bit more grated parmigiano and some fresh chopped parsley.",
