Stir and bring to the boil.

In the Punjab this one which you can try making yourself is common: 5 tbsps coriander seeds, 3 tbsps cumin seeds, 2 1/2 tbsps black peppercorns, 2 1/2 black cardamom seeds, 2 in cinnamon stick, 4-5 cloves, 1/6 nutmeg. \nPut the coriander and the cumin into a cast-iron frying-pan over a medium heat.Stir until lightly roasted. Allow to cool. Grind with the remaining ingredients in a clean coffee grinder and store in a tightly lidded jar.This rich flavoursome dish originates in the fertile Punjab, a state now divided between India and Pakistan. There is nothing more important to a Punjabi man's diet than bread, and meals are accompanied by flat round cornbread rotis or rich, flaky pan-fried paratha layered with ghee(clarified butter).Rice is reserved for special occasions or for rice pudding, for the only food that makes a Punjabi feel he has eaten a proper meal is his bread! You of course, can serve this dish with plain boiled rice.","ingredients":[{"id":10093754,"name":"ginger garlic paste","localizedName":"ginger garlic paste","image":"ginger-garlic-paste.png"},{"id":1022030,"name":"black peppercorns","localizedName":"black peppercorns","image":"black-pepper.png"},{"id":93632,"name":"clarified butter","localizedName":"clarified butter","image":"ghee.jpg"},{"id":2013,"name":"whole coriander seeds","localizedName":"whole coriander seeds","image":"coriander-seeds.jpg"},{"id":11165,"name":"fresh cilantro","localizedName":"fresh cilantro","image":"cilantro.png"},{"id":0,"name":"cardamom seeds","localizedName":"cardamom seeds","image":"cardamom.jpg"},{"id":2031,"name":"cayenne pepper","localizedName":"cayenne pepper","image":"chili-powder.jpg"},{"id":1002010,"name":"cinnamon stick","localizedName":"cinnamon stick","image":"cinnamon.jpg"},{"id":93663,"name":"garam masala","localizedName":"garam masala","image":"garam-masala.jpg"},{"id":11547,"name":"tomato puree","localizedName":"tomato puree","image":"tomato-paste.jpg"},{"id":2014,"name":"cumin seeds","localizedName":"cumin seeds","image":"ground-cumin.jpg"},{"id":9152,"name":"lemon juice","localizedName":"lemon juice","image":"lemon-juice.jpg"},{"id":17305,"name":"lamb chop","localizedName":"lamb chop","image":"lamb-chops.png"},{"id":1012013,"name":"coriander","localizedName":"coriander","image":"ground-coriander.jpg"},{"id":18023,"name":"cornbread","localizedName":"cornbread","image":"cornbread.jpg"},{"id":11529,"name":"tomato","localizedName":"tomato","image":"tomato.png"},{"id":99217,"name":"paratha","localizedName":"paratha","image":"pita-bread.jpg"},{"id":1116,"name":"yogurt","localizedName":"yogurt","image":"plain-yogurt.jpg"},{"id":1002011,"name":"clove","localizedName":"clove","image":"cloves.jpg"},{"id":14209,"name":"coffee","localizedName":"coffee","image":"brewed-coffee.jpg"},{"id":11215,"name":"garlic","localizedName":"garlic","image":"garlic.png"},{"id":11216,"name":"ginger","localizedName":"ginger","image":"ginger.png"},{"id":2025,"name":"nutmeg","localizedName":"nutmeg","image":"ground-nutmeg.jpg"},{"id":11282,"name":"onion","localizedName":"onion","image":"brown-onion.png"},{"id":18064,"name":"bread","localizedName":"bread","image":"white-bread.jpg"},{"id":1002014,"name":"cumin","localizedName":"cumin","image":"ground-cumin.jpg"},{"id":0,"name":"sauce","localizedName":"sauce","image":""},{"id":14412,"name":"water","localizedName":"water","image":"water.png"},{"id":93632,"name":"ghee","localizedName":"ghee","image":"ghee.jpg"},{"id":1065062,"name":"meat","localizedName":"meat","image":"whole-chicken.jpg"},{"id":20444,"name":"rice","localizedName":"rice","image":"uncooked-white-rice.png"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","localizedName":"salt","image":"salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404669,"name":"sauce pan","localizedName":"sauce pan","image":"sauce-pan.jpg"},{"id":404726,"name":"blender","localizedName":"blender","image":"blender.png"},{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","localizedName":"frying pan","image":"pan.png"},{"id":404666,"name":"wok","localizedName":"wok","image":"wok.png"}],"length":{"number":60,"unit":"minutes"}}]}],"spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/lamb-chops-masala-649199"},{"vegetarian":false,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":false,"dairyFree":false,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":false,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":10,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"aggregateLikes":2,"spoonacularScore":24.0,"healthScore":3.0,"creditsText":"Foodista.com – The Cooking Encyclopedia Everyone Can Edit","license":"CC BY 3.0","sourceName":"Foodista","pricePerServing":93.27,"id":650650,"title":"Make Ahead Quiche","readyInMinutes":45,"servings":8,"sourceUrl":"https://www.foodista.com/recipe/SLFFTBGD/make-ahead-quiche","image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/650650-312x231.jpg","imageType":"jpg","summary":"Make Ahead Quiche might be just the <b>Mediterranean</b> recipe you are searching for.

Bring the mixture to a boil, stirring to dissolve the salt and sugar.  Reduce to heat to low and simmer for 10 min so the flavors of the herbs can be drawn out. \nPour the brine into a deep set large bowl and cool it down with your ice water.  Set aside.Clean the chicken by rinsing out the cavity and outer skin and place on a clean surface.  Be sure not to contaminate any vegetables or other ingredients, because no one is a fan of salmonella!  \nPlace the chicken in the brine,  make sure it is completely immersed in the brine.  Cover and allow to marinate for at least an hour and up to 6 hours.Preheat the oven to 375F.\nRemove the chicken from the brine and place on a clean surface.  Pat the chicken dry with a paper towel as shown.  Separate the skin from the flesh, you can do this by carefully inserting your fingers underneath the skin and gently pull up to create a space or pocket.  Take the butter and rub it underneath the skin and flesh  this will make your chicken moist and tender while accentuating the flavor of the herbs in the meat.  Coat the skin with te remaining herbs and place in a roasting pan, if more herbs are needed just add more.\nBake the chicken for about 1 hour and 10 minutes, basting the chicken half way through and again during the last 10 minutes.  To test the doneness of your chicken, insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the breast, it should read 165F.  If you do not own a thermometer, cut into the chicken and if it releases pink juices it is undercooked.  Your chicken is done when the juices are a clear yellow.\nTransfer the chicken to a carving board and allow it to rest for 10-20 minutes.  This allows the juices to settle into the meat so it does not end up running out all over the board.  To serve, begin carving the legs it is easiest to cut at the joints.  \nRemove the wings and then the legs and thighs the same way.  To carve each breast, start at the breabone and cut downward and parallel to the rib cage.  Then make a deep horizontal cut right above the thigh and wing joints.
