If your dough is still extremely wet (more batter-like than dough-like) you can add a little bit of extra flour at the end, a tablespoon at a time, until it comes together enough to handle.Scrape the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface.

Clean off the paddle attachment, scrape the sides of the bowl and add the dough attachment to the mixer.\nWith the mixer going on low speed, add the remaining whole wheat flour a little at a time until the dough starts coming together.\nAfter two of the remaining cups are added, let the mixer knead the dough for a minute or so.
