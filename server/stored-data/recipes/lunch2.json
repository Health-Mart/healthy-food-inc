You can use snapper, dory, kingklip or hake.\nI like to cut away the belly because its alot thinner in thickness. \nCut the steak portion into large chunks. They will shrink when cooked, so dont cut too small a piece.\nI dont waste the belly parts. I like to roll them up. And then tie the roll of belly fish meat with a single strand of chive, so that it will look as chunky as the rest of the fish meat.\nSet aside the prepared fish.\nPrepare the red capsicum. Slice off one end.\nAnd then slice off the other end. This will give you a tube. Slide a knife around the inside walls of the red capsicum. \nRemove the inner seeds and membrane. Slice the hollow tube of red capsicum into half and then slice into thin strips.\nGrate or mince some peeled ginger to get approximately 1 tablespoon of ginger.\nPrepare a handful of spices/herbs  2 stalks of lemon grass, 10 lime leaves and a handful of curry leaves.\n\nAdd 2 tablespoons of cooking oil to a pan.\nWhen the oil is hot, add 3 tablespoons of red curry paste of your choice.\nI always use the A1 brand from Singapore. Find a good curry paste that works for you where you are, and then stock your larder with it!\nStir fry the paste in the hot pan for a minute.\n\nAdd the ginger. \nAdd the garlic. Stir fry well to combine.\n\nAdd the lemon grass, lime leaves and curry leaves. Stir well to combine.\n\nAdd 1 tablespoon of tamarind paste. Stir well to combine and dissolve the tamarind.\nWhen the curry paste is nice and fragrant, about 1 to 2 mins later, add 3 tablespoons of Shaoxing Huatiao wine.\n\nAdd 400ml of coconut cream. Every brand of coconut cream is different. Some are thicker than others. But dont add water at this point. And dont use coconut milk instead of cream or light coconut milk. Its not the same.\n\nAdd 1 tablespoon of oyster sauce. \nAdd 1 tablespoon of sugar. Stir well to combine and leave to simmer on a low heat. The sauce will get very thick. Dont add water here because when the fish is placed in to cook, it will introduce alot of moisture to the sauce.\nWhen the sauce has been simmering gently for 2 to 3 mins, taste the sauce. Adjust the taste here because every brand of oyster sauce/tamarind/wine is different and the sauce needs to be fine tuned accordingly. If its too sour, add a little more sugar. If it tastes flat, add a little wine and oyster sauce. Stir well to combine.\nWhen the sauce is ready, gently add the fish into the pan. Keep the stove at medium heat and let the fish cook slowly in the sauce. Try not to handle the fish too much in the sauce as it will cause the fish to flake or break up.\nAs the fish cooks, it will release moisture into the sauce and thin it out. Gently cover the fish with the sauce. Cover the pan and let it simmer till the fish is cooked through. It usually takes about 5 to 8 minutes depending on the thickness of the fish.\nWhen the fish is cooked, add the red capsicum strips and gently stir through till they are warmed through but not cooked till soft. If the sauce is too thick at this point, add a couple of tablespoons of water and stir well to combine.\nDish out the fish curry gently because the fish may flake or break up. \nGarnish with coriander leaves.","ingredients":[{"id":99009,"name":"light coconut milk","localizedName":"light coconut milk","image":"coconut-milk"},{"id":93605,"name":"red curry paste","localizedName":"red curry paste","image":"chili-paste.png"},{"id":9322,"name":"tamarind paste","localizedName":"tamarind paste","image":"tamarind.png"},{"id":12115,"name":"coconut cream","localizedName":"coconut cream","image":"coconut-cream.jpg"},{"id":12118,"name":"coconut milk","localizedName":"coconut milk","image":"coconut-milk.png"},{"id":93604,"name":"curry leaves","localizedName":"curry leaves","image":"curry-leaves.jpg"},{"id":6176,"name":"oyster sauce","localizedName":"oyster sauce","image":"oyster-sauce.jpg"},{"id":11821,"name":"red pepper","localizedName":"red pepper","image":"red-pepper.jpg"},{"id":4582,"name":"cooking oil","localizedName":"cooking oil","image":"vegetable-oil.jpg"},{"id":93605,"name":"curry paste","localizedName":"curry paste","image":"chili-paste.png"},{"id":11972,"name":"lemon grass","localizedName":"lemon grass","image":"lemongrass.png"},{"id":93633,"name":"lime leaves","localizedName":"lime leaves","image":"lime-leaves.jpg"},{"id":0,"name":"white fish","localizedName":"white fish","image":"fish-fillet.jpg"},{"id":1012013,"name":"coriander","localizedName":"coriander","image":"ground-coriander.jpg"},{"id":1019322,"name":"tamarind","localizedName":"tamarind","image":"tamarind.png"},{"id":15101,"name":"snapper","localizedName":"snapper","image":"snapper.jpg"},{"id":11215,"name":"garlic","localizedName":"garlic","image":"garlic.png"},{"id":11216,"name":"ginger","localizedName":"ginger","image":"ginger.png"},{"id":2035,"name":"spices","localizedName":"spices","image":"spices.png"},{"id":11156,"name":"chives","localizedName":"chives","image":"fresh-chives.jpg"},{"id":1053,"name":"cream","localizedName":"cream","image":"fluid-cream.jpg"},{"id":2015,"name":"curry powder","localizedName":"curry powder","image":"curry-powder.jpg"},{"id":1002044,"name":"herbs","localizedName":"herbs","image":"mixed-fresh-herbs.jpg"},{"id":0,"name":"ground meat","localizedName":"ground meat","image":"fresh-ground-beef.jpg"},{"id":0,"name":"sauce","localizedName":"sauce","image":""},{"id":93818,"name":"seeds","localizedName":"seeds","image":"sunflower-seeds.jpg"},{"id":23232,"name":"steak","localizedName":"steak","image":"ribeye-raw.jpg"},{"id":1006615,"name":"stock","localizedName":"stock","image":"chicken-broth.png"},{"id":19335,"name":"sugar","localizedName":"sugar","image":"sugar-in-bowl.png"},{"id":14412,"name":"water","localizedName":"water","image":"water.png"},{"id":10115261,"name":"fish","localizedName":"fish","image":"fish-fillet.jpg"},{"id":98956,"name":"hake","localizedName":"hake","image":"hake-filet.jpg"},{"id":1065062,"name":"meat","localizedName":"meat","image":"whole-chicken.jpg"},{"id":0,"name":"roll","localizedName":"roll","image":"dinner-yeast-rolls.jpg"},{"id":14084,"name":"wine","localizedName":"wine","image":"red-wine.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404745,"name":"knife","localizedName":"knife","image":"chefs-knife.jpg"},{"id":404794,"name":"stove","localizedName":"stove","image":"oven.jpg"},{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","localizedName":"frying pan","image":"pan.png"}],"length":{"number":8,"unit":"minutes"}}]}],"spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/assam-fish-curry-632983"},{"vegetarian":true,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":true,"dairyFree":false,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":false,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":24,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"aggregateLikes":3,"spoonacularScore":43.0,"healthScore":9.0,"creditsText":"Foodista.com – The Cooking Encyclopedia Everyone Can Edit","license":"CC BY 3.0","sourceName":"Foodista","pricePerServing":763.6,"id":660161,"title":"Simply Bean Soup","readyInMinutes":45,"servings":1,"sourceUrl":"https://www.foodista.com/recipe/55R4S8RW/simply-bean-soup","image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/660161-312x231.jpg","imageType":"jpg","summary":"If you want to add more <b>gluten free and lacto ovo vegetarian</b> recipes to your recipe box, Simply Bean Soup might be a recipe you should try.

My folks originated from this area of the sub-continet and hence this was popular at home.\nPut the ginger and garlic into the container of an electric blender with 2-3 tablespoons of water and blend to a paste.\nPut the chops, tomatoes, onions, cayenne pepper, yoghurt, salt and ginger-garlic paste into a large wok or heavy-bottomed saucepan. Stir and bring to the boil.

In the Punjab this one which you can try making yourself is common: 5 tbsps coriander seeds, 3 tbsps cumin seeds, 2 1/2 tbsps black peppercorns, 2 1/2 black cardamom seeds, 2 in cinnamon stick, 4-5 cloves, 1/6 nutmeg. \nPut the coriander and the cumin into a cast-iron frying-pan over a medium heat.Stir until lightly roasted. Allow to cool. Grind with the remaining ingredients in a clean coffee grinder and store in a tightly lidded jar.This rich flavoursome dish originates in the fertile Punjab, a state now divided between India and Pakistan. There is nothing more important to a Punjabi man's diet than bread, and meals are accompanied by flat round cornbread rotis or rich, flaky pan-fried paratha layered with ghee(clarified butter).Rice is reserved for special occasions or for rice pudding, for the only food that makes a Punjabi feel he has eaten a proper meal is his bread! You of course, can serve this dish with plain boiled rice.","ingredients":[{"id":10093754,"name":"ginger garlic paste","localizedName":"ginger garlic paste","image":"ginger-garlic-paste.png"},{"id":1022030,"name":"black peppercorns","localizedName":"black peppercorns","image":"black-pepper.png"},{"id":93632,"name":"clarified butter","localizedName":"clarified butter","image":"ghee.jpg"},{"id":2013,"name":"whole coriander seeds","localizedName":"whole coriander seeds","image":"coriander-seeds.jpg"},{"id":11165,"name":"fresh cilantro","localizedName":"fresh cilantro","image":"cilantro.png"},{"id":0,"name":"cardamom seeds","localizedName":"cardamom seeds","image":"cardamom.jpg"},{"id":2031,"name":"cayenne pepper","localizedName":"cayenne pepper","image":"chili-powder.jpg"},{"id":1002010,"name":"cinnamon stick","localizedName":"cinnamon stick","image":"cinnamon.jpg"},{"id":93663,"name":"garam masala","localizedName":"garam masala","image":"garam-masala.jpg"},{"id":11547,"name":"tomato puree","localizedName":"tomato puree","image":"tomato-paste.jpg"},{"id":2014,"name":"cumin seeds","localizedName":"cumin seeds","image":"ground-cumin.jpg"},{"id":9152,"name":"lemon juice","localizedName":"lemon juice","image":"lemon-juice.jpg"},{"id":17305,"name":"lamb chop","localizedName":"lamb chop","image":"lamb-chops.png"},{"id":1012013,"name":"coriander","localizedName":"coriander","image":"ground-coriander.jpg"},{"id":18023,"name":"cornbread","localizedName":"cornbread","image":"cornbread.jpg"},{"id":11529,"name":"tomato","localizedName":"tomato","image":"tomato.png"},{"id":99217,"name":"paratha","localizedName":"paratha","image":"pita-bread.jpg"},{"id":1116,"name":"yogurt","localizedName":"yogurt","image":"plain-yogurt.jpg"},{"id":1002011,"name":"clove","localizedName":"clove","image":"cloves.jpg"},{"id":14209,"name":"coffee","localizedName":"coffee","image":"brewed-coffee.jpg"},{"id":11215,"name":"garlic","localizedName":"garlic","image":"garlic.png"},{"id":11216,"name":"ginger","localizedName":"ginger","image":"ginger.png"},{"id":2025,"name":"nutmeg","localizedName":"nutmeg","image":"ground-nutmeg.jpg"},{"id":11282,"name":"onion","localizedName":"onion","image":"brown-onion.png"},{"id":18064,"name":"bread","localizedName":"bread","image":"white-bread.jpg"},{"id":1002014,"name":"cumin","localizedName":"cumin","image":"ground-cumin.jpg"},{"id":0,"name":"sauce","localizedName":"sauce","image":""},{"id":14412,"name":"water","localizedName":"water","image":"water.png"},{"id":93632,"name":"ghee","localizedName":"ghee","image":"ghee.jpg"},{"id":1065062,"name":"meat","localizedName":"meat","image":"whole-chicken.jpg"},{"id":20444,"name":"rice","localizedName":"rice","image":"uncooked-white-rice.png"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","localizedName":"salt","image":"salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404669,"name":"sauce pan","localizedName":"sauce pan","image":"sauce-pan.jpg"},{"id":404726,"name":"blender","localizedName":"blender","image":"blender.png"},{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","localizedName":"frying pan","image":"pan.png"},{"id":404666,"name":"wok","localizedName":"wok","image":"wok.png"}],"length":{"number":60,"unit":"minutes"}}]}],"spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/lamb-chops-masala-649199"},{"vegetarian":false,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":false,"dairyFree":false,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":false,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":10,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"aggregateLikes":2,"spoonacularScore":24.0,"healthScore":3.0,"creditsText":"Foodista.com – The Cooking Encyclopedia Everyone Can Edit","license":"CC BY 3.0","sourceName":"Foodista","pricePerServing":93.27,"id":650650,"title":"Make Ahead Quiche","readyInMinutes":45,"servings":8,"sourceUrl":"https://www.foodista.com/recipe/SLFFTBGD/make-ahead-quiche","image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/650650-312x231.jpg","imageType":"jpg","summary":"Make Ahead Quiche might be just the <b>Mediterranean</b> recipe you are searching for.
