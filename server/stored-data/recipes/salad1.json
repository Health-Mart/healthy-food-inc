Rinse with cold water and drain.  \nAdd orzo to the same pot.  Boil until tender but still firm to bite; about 8 minutes.  \nDrain and cool.In a large nonreactive bowl, mix together orzo, sugar snap peas, tomatoes, cucumber, green onions, parsley, mint, and lemon zest.To make the dressing:  \nCombine lemon juice, lemon zest, and garlic in a medium bowl.  Gradually whisk in olive oil.  \nAdd 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper.\nPour enough dressing over the salad to coat well.  You may have a little dressing left over.  Season salad with salt and pepper, if needed.  (The salad can be made 1 hour ahead.  Do not let it sit longer, or the peas and onions will start to lose their bright color.  Cover salad and refrigerate.  Bring to room temperature before serving.)To serve, line shallow serving bowl with lettuce leaves, if you desire.  Mound salad in bowl.",

Peel oranges and cut into thin, round slices with very sharp knife. \nCut rounds in half and pick out seeds.\nPlace oranges in large work bowl, drain onion of all excess liquid and add onion to oranges. \nSprinkle mixture with pepper. \nCombine oil and vinegar to make the vinaigrette.\nPour over oranges, cover and set aside in cool place to infuse for 30 minutes.\nAdd cucumber, pomegranate arils and olives. Adjust seasoning, then scatter mint over top and serve.This recipe yields 6 servings.Wine Suggestions: Rose and blush wines, such as American white Zinfandels, are a good beverage choice when pairing with foods that are fruity, acidic, spicy and complex, such as this salad.Comments: The inspiration for this salad is North Africa, where pomegranates are used in a variety of creative ways. The salad's secret is its startling interplay of flavors: the tartness of the fruit, the onion - the infusion of the onion is an important step, so do not skip it - and most importantly, the saltiness of the olives. The lemon removes the sharpness of the raw onion and colors it pink, an important visual note in the salad's appearance.",

Season with a pinch of salt.\nWhile the beans are cooking, heat a small pan with 1/2 tablespoon of oil. When the pan is hot, add the fresh corn. Stir constantly, and let it cook for about 4 minutes. The kernels will turn into a light yellow color when they're ready. Season with a pinch of salt.\nIn a large bowl, mix the lentils, corn, tomatoes, peaches, feta, onion, and parsley together. \nAdd the lemon juice and a teaspoon of salt to the salad. \nAdd more salt if necessary.\n\nServe the lentil salad with the beans on the side.\nRefrigerate leftovers in an airtight container.",

Stir in couscous, let simmer in pan for about two minutes.Cover pan and remove from heat, let stand for 5-10 minutes (or, if you're using boxed couscous, just follow the cooking directions on the package).When couscous has cooled, run your (clean!) hands through it to break up any clumps.When garlic is cool enough to handle, peel it the garlic and using a small knife chop the garlic very finely.\nMix the garlic with the olive oil, warm water and the juice of one lemon in a small bowl or liquid measuring cup and whisk until combined.It's best to get this as well mixed as possible, for which I broke out my Mexican molcajete grinding bowl. But a blender or food processor would work just as well.",

(You do not have to cook the western style couscous which is pre-steamed and instant.)\nPreheat the oven to 400* F. Grease an ovenproof dish with nonstick spray. Arrange the vegetables, except the asparagus in a single layer in the prepared dish and drizzle with olive oil. Roast for about 20 to 25 minutes until the vegetables are done but still crisp - add the asparagus after the first 10 minutes of roasting and stir the vegetables slightly. When the vegetables are done sprinkle with a little balsamic vinegar.\nWhen the couscous are done stir in the extra-virgin olive oil, sun-dried tomatoes, and pesto to make the couscous moist and fragrant. \nAdd the balsamic vinegar, salt and pepper.\n\nAdd the roasted vegetables to the couscous and mix with the couscous. \nAdd the feta cheese and mix with the roasted vegetables and couscous. This salad can be served warm or cooled down to room temperature and it is delicious served with beef or chicken.",

                            "step": "Pre-heat the oven to 200 deg Celsius (400 F).\nStart by roasting the beetroots. Clean the beets of all mud and trim the stems. Wrap each beet tightly in aluminum foil. \nPlace the wrapped beets on a pan and in a 200 deg Celsius oven for 30 to 40mins. They are done when they are very tender.\nWhile the beets are cooking, use a peeler and peel an orange, taking note to get as much of zest and as little of pith (the white parts) as possible. Stack the strips of orange zest and cut into fine strips with a sharp knife. Set aside.\nClean and dry the duck breasts. Score the skin of the duck. Make cuts into the fat layer and take care not to cut into the meat layer. Rub some salt into the skin side only of the duck. \nAdd the duck breasts to a clean and COLD pan. Do not add any oil. \nPlace the pan on the stove and turn the heat to medium.\nAs the pan heats up, the fat from the duck will render off and the skin will brown beautifully. Always keep the heat to between medium to medium-high. Never use high heat as the skin will burn before the duck is cooked through. Once the skin is a gorgeous dark golden brown, flip the duck breasts to the other side and cook for a few more minutes till the other sides are also golden brown. Be careful not to overcook the duck. Set the cooked duck aside and leave to rest covered with foil. Duck, like beef must be rested. The resting time is half that of cooking time. If the duck was cooked for 6 mins, then it should be rested for at least 3 minutes.\nWhile the duck is resting, make the vinaigrette. Squeeze the juice of the zested orange into a bowl. About 5 to 6 tablespoons of juice. \nAdd 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil. Use the best quality one you have. \nAdd 4 teaspoons of balsamic vinegar. \nAdd salt and pepper to taste. \nWhisk the mixture well. Set aside.\nWhen the beets are done, remove them from the oven and let them cool for a few minutes so that they are easier to hold. Put on some disposable gloves (else get blood red stained fingers later). Open the foil-wrapped beets. Using the rough surface of each piece of foil, rub the beets with the foil to remove the skin. \nCut the cooked beets into small pieces. Set aside in a bowl.\n\nDrizzle 2 tablespoons of vinaigrette into the beets. \nAdd 2 teaspoons of honey. Toss well to coat the beets with the dressing.\nSlice the rested duck into thin slices. The meat should be a beautiful pink.\n\nServe by layering the salad with greens, nuts and cheese of your choice, and the duck and beets.\nI like rocket greens with fresh basil or mint, mandarin orange segments, toasted almond flakes or pine nuts and some shaved parmesan cheese or some crumbed feta or goats cheese.\n\nGarnish with the orange zest.\nTrickle the vinaigrette over the salad.\nBest served immediately.",

Feel free to add some vegetable scraps if available (unused piece of carrot, onion, celery, etc.) \nDrain the farro in a colander &amp; remove vegetable scraps if used.  Allow to cool for a few minutes.In a large separate bowl combine the farro with radicchio, nuts &amp; pomegranate seeds. Give it a good mix and season with salt &amp; pepper.For the dressing: \nDrizzle over the salad a couple tablespoons of vinegar followed by three times the amount of extra virgin olive oil. Give it another good mix.To finish, give it a good shave of fresh truffles, if not available truffle salt or oil works well too. Top with a few pulls of a potato peeler across a wedge of parmesan.Allow to sit for at least 20 minutes up to a day - it needs a little time for it to all come together.Before serving - give it one last good stir, taste &amp; adjust the seasoning - making sure the dressing is balanced (not too vinegary or oily).",

Bring to a boil then reduce to a simmer for 20 minutes (or until the little guys are fork tender). Now, how firm you want the potatoes is up to you, I like a certain amount of resistance in my potato salad. Too soft and the salad degenerates into some mealy spread. But hey, if you like that...Meanwhile make the dressing. \nPut the mayonnaise in a large bowl and mix in the diced celery, onion, bacon, cornichons, hard boiled eggs, Maggi Seasoning, smoked paprika, and the lemon juice. Make sure everything gets evenly distributed and everyone gets to know each other.N.B. - I should add a quick note about the Maggi Seasoning. Maggi Seasoning is an extract of pure vegetable proteins. Made in China, this sauce features a distinctive flavour and aroma, which adds zest and depth to all kinds of food. I discovered it in Alastair Hendys cookbook entitled Home Cook: More Than 180 Recipes for the Food We Love to Eat. In his recipe for his Mums potato salad he noted that it gives the salad a savoury edge, and perfects it. He wasnt lying. If you dont have any Maggi you could substitute equal parts dark soy sauce and Worcestershire sauce, but the stuff is cheap and available everywhere now, Id suggest just getting some.When the potatoes are ready, drain in a colander. While still warm toss with dressing making sure that everything is thoroughly coated. Season with kosher salt and long pepper and finish with a pinch of smoked paprika. Leave in the fridge for a while until all the flavours have had a chance to marry.",
