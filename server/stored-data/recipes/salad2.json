You can use more or less based on how moist you like your chicken salad.Season with salt and pepper to taste, go easy on the seasoning at this point because the main seasoning will occur at the end when you add the spices. Drop in the diced celery, carrot, cucumber and grapes and mix well. Once all the ingredients have been combined, add additional mayonnaise if you prefer a wetter consistency to the salad.Once the consistency is right, add in curry powder and turmeric powder. These are they key ingredients, so make sure you are using high quality spices. Start with a small amount of each spice and gradually add to taste - the measurements here are just recommendations, you should taste test as you go along. If possible, pop your mixing bowl into the fridge for an hour to let the flavors marry.\nServe of the Curry Chicken Salad on top of salad greens, no dressing necessary.",

Then with long slender strokes, slice the onion going against the layers.\nReserve the slices in a separate bowl.\nStack the bacon on top of each other and cut sticks about the same width as your onions.\nIn a cold pan, it is critical that the pan be stone cold, place your bacon sticks and fry over medium heat.\nCook until all the fat has rendered from the bacon and they are dark and crispy.\nTake the bacon out of the pan and reserve three tablespoons of the bacon fat and use a paper towel to mop up the excess.\nCaramelize the onions in the same pan. Cook over medium heat for 15 minutes or until they are amber in color and slightly soft. You don't need to cook them all the way soft.\nSomewhere along the recipe timeline your potatoes should have finished cooking. When they're done, drain them in a colander.\nWhen they are thoroughly dry, cut them in wedges roughly half the size of a golf ball.\n\nPut the wedges in a large bowl along with mayo, the bacon, caramelized onions, most of the green onions, and rendered bacon fat.\nFold this together careful not to mash the potatoes and taste for seasoning.\nThis can be made ahead and stored in the refrigerator, or eaten warm straight from the bowl.\n\nGarnish with reserved green onions. And as always, Chow!",

Blend until smooth, then slowly add extra virgin olive oil, continue blending until well combined.\nAdd pine nuts and dried cranberries into the large bowl with the kale. \nPour the vinaigrette over and toss all ingredients together. \nTransfer the kale salad to a large serving bowl or small bowls for individual servings.Use a vegetable peeler, shave some Parmesan cheese on top and season with freshly ground black pepper. \nServe!",

Don't overcrowd the pan, or the pan won't stay hot enough to give the scallops a good sear. If you have a lot of scallops, it's better to work in batches.\nOnce you've placed the scallops in the pan, don't touch them. (\nLet them do their thing!) If you give in to the temptation to move the scallops around the pan, all you'll be doing is preventing them from forming the nice brown crust that you want. Because of variations in scallop thickness, pan temperatures and so on, it's not easy to pinpoint an exact cooking time. But after a couple of minutes, it's OK to peek underneath. If you see a nice, caramel-colored crust on the underside, they're ready to flip.\nPlate your salad and place 4 scallops on top. Scallops start to turn rubbery if you wait too long to serve them, so get them on the plate right away. And be sure to serve them with the beautiful caramel-colored crust facing up.",

Grill 2-3 mins per side on a hot grill. \nLayer it up... corn tortilla, salad and those gorgeous shrimp. Finish it off with a squeeze of fresh lime juice!*****Now for the salad. We had this for lunch the following day. You can heat the shrimp up a bit in a hot pan or serve cold in this salad. The base is baby arugula, topped with half a sliced avocado, the grilled shrimp, plum tomato and a slice of turkey bacon (my fav, Applegate brand turkey bacon! No nitrates or nitrites added). Dressed super simply with lime juice and a drizzle of olive oil.",

It is important to get the oil nice and hot (not smoking, just before that point) your shrimp should sizzle when added to the pan. Check the back of the shrimp and when you see the colour change about half way up, turn them over. Do the same on the other side. This should only take a minute to two minutes maximum on both sides  otherwise you will get a rubbery result if you leave it too long. Squeeze over the lime juice  this too should bubble and reduce. \nAdd a little salt and pepper, stir through, remove from the heat and set aside.\n\nMix the dressing ingredients together, check for flavour, adjust if need be and set aside.\n\nPlace all the salad ingredients in a bowl except the avocado and the salt and pepper. Prepare the avocado as you are about to serve otherwise it will turn brown. Once it is covered in the lime dressing, this will slow down the oxidization process and it wont go brown so easily.\n4.When you are ready to serve mix  of the avocado through the salad and add the dressing. Toss everything together. Taste to see if you need any salt and pepper. \nPlace your shrimp on top of the salad with the rest of the avocado and sprinkle/pour any residue from the pan over your salad in which you cooked the shrimp. This is great flavour, so you dont want to lose it.",

Allow to cool completely before making into potato salad (otherwise the sauce doesnt turn out right).\nIn a medium sized mixing bowl, mix together the remaining ingredients except the chives. \nMix well and then toss with the cooled potatoes. \nMix gently so as not to break the potatoes apart. Taste to make sure the salt and pepper is the right balance. \nAdd more salt and pepper to taste.",

I like my salads to have a strong dressing flavor, so if you are the same way, use all of the dressing from the above recipe  if you like the flavor to be more subtle, use half and then test out the salad before adding more.Allow salad to sit in the refrigerator at least 30 minutes before serving so that the vinegar (and other liquids) soften the endive and radicchio leaves a little and break down some of the bitter taste.",

Set aside.\nSpiralize the squash using Blade B. Once the squash has been spiralized, I like to give all the noodles several rough chops so that they're easy to eat (otherwise, the noodles are too long). Chop up the parts of the squash that did not get spiralized and add them to the salad. If you do not have a spiralizer, create vegetable noodles with a julienne peeler or vegetable ribbons with a regular peeler.\nIn a large bowl, toss the noodles, diced peaches, cherry tomatoes, and 1/3 to 1/2 cup of the pesto sauce together.\nStore the unused pesto and leftover salad in separate containers and refrigerate.",
