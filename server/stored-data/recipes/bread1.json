Then tip in the flour, salt, and butter and mix well. \nMix in the starter dough mixture and knead for 10 minutes. As this is quite a wet dough it is best to this in a food processor (with the dough hook attachment), 5 minutes on a slow speed then 5 on a fast speed.Tip the dough out onto a floured surface, dust with flour, cover, and leave for 30 minutes to rise. You will need quite a lo of flour for dusting as it is quite sticky. At 10 minute intervals, use your hands to punch flat the dough, stretch out and fold over the edges on themselves and turn over.Grease the loaf tin. Shaking off any excess flour, form a loaf shape then put the dough in the tin. Cover and leave to rise for a further 30 minutes. After 10 minutes rising, use a very sharp knife to score a 2 cm line down the centre of the dough. This helps create a nice crust.Preheat the oven to 230C. \nPut the bread on the middle shelf of the oven. Using the spray bottle, squirt on and around the bread to create steam. This keeps the bread moist and gives a nice crust. \nBake for 45 minutes.

Allow it to foam for 10 minutes. Then add the rest of the ingredients for the dough. \nMix and then knead them, using a mixer with a bread hook, or by hand, until you have a soft, smooth and elastic dough (about 8-10 minutes).\nPut the dough in a oiled bowl and let it rise, covered, for 2 hours or until it's puffy and nearly doubled in size\nLightly grease/butter a 9inch round cake pan that's at least 2inch deep (or grease a 9inch or 10inch springform pan).Toss the apple chunks with the sugar, cinnamon and rum.Gently deflate the dough, transfer it to a lightly greased work surface, and flatte n it into a rough rectangle, about 8 x 10 inches.\nSpread half the apple chunks in the center of the dough (see remarks for details).Fold a short edge of the dough over the apple in order to cover it, patting firmly to seal the apples and spread the dough a bit.\nSpread the remaining apple atop the folded-over dough.Cover the apples with the other side of the dough, again patting firmly (Basically, you've folded the dough like a letter, enclosing the apples inside.).Take a long knife and cut the apple-filled dough into 16 pieces. \nCut in half, then each half in halves, etc ... (This will be very, VERY messy; the dough is slippery, apples will fall out, sugar syrup will ooze... it's not pretty.

Lots of apple chunks will fall out during this process; just tuck them in among the dough pieces, or simply spread them on top.).Cover the challah gently with lightly greased plastic wrap or a damp towel and let it rise for about 1- 1 1/2 hours, until it's a generous 2inches high (It should just crest the rim of a 9inch round cake pan). Twenty minutes before the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 325 F.\nPlace the bread in the lower third of the oven. \nBake it for 55 minutes, or until the top is at least light golden brown all over and has no white spots.\nRemove the challah from the oven, and after 5 minutes loosen the edges and carefully transfer it to a rack.\nLet cool completely.

Begin by roasting the garlic, jalapenos and bell pepper. Leave the skin on the garlic cloves, wrap in tin foil and place wrapped garlic and all peppers on a cookie sheet; roast for 20 - 25 minutes, until veggies look puffy and skin is browned and flaying away from the flesh of the peppers.  A few minutes after putting the garlic and peppers in the oven, open both bags of collard greens, spread the greens over a cookie sheet and place in oven for 12 minutes with the roasting peppers in order to thaw the greens.\n\nRemove the greens and roasted veggies from the oven; allow to cool. While cooling, crack the eggs into a large mixing bowl. Beat eggs, add the grapeseed oil and stir.  Once the greens are cool enough to handle, take large handfuls of the collard greens and squeeze all the water out of them over the sink. Once the water is squeezed out, put the handfuls in the mixing bowl with the egg.  Do this for all of the collards.\nUsing your fingers, remove the skin from the peppers, remove the seeds and chop into small pieces.  \nRemove the garlic cloves from the foil, remove the skin and coarsely chop the garlic.  \nAdd chopped peppers and garlic to the mixing bowl with the collards and egg.  \nAdd salt and crushed red pepper to the mixing bowl.  Using a fork, mix everything together until everything is coated with egg.\nLine a baking sheet with parchment paper. Turn the collard mixture out on top of the parchment paper.  Using a fork, press mixture firmly into the parchment paper. There is enough in this recipe to cover a 12 x 17 baking sheet, though be prepared to do a lot of pressing in order to evenly disburse the mixture over the full sheet.\n\nBake in the oven for 30  35 minutes until the edges are just barely beginning to brown and the collards feel dry and firm to the touch.\nAllow to cool and pulling the edges of the parchment paper, place on a chopping block. Chop the bread into desired sizes. This makes 12 decent sized squares.
