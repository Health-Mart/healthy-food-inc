Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer for an hour, the liquid should be reduced by at least half. Strain the stock, using a fine-mesh strainer, discarding solids (you should have 3-4 c. of stock) season lightly with salt to taste. *You can do this step a day ahead of time, and keep the stock in the refrigerator until ready to use, any longer and I would suggest freezing the stock. Also if you do this, you'll also want to freeze the crab meat as well, my preferred way to freeze crab meat is by placing the meat in a ziplock freezer bag and adding a few tablespoons of milk.\n\nCut the kernels from the ears of corn into a large bowl (you should have around 3 c. corn). Using the back of a chef's knife, scrape the spent cobs to extract the sweet, milky corn pulp into a separate bowl. \nAdd a cup of the corn kernels into the bowl with the corn pulp and reserve the remaining corn kernels.\nTo make the soup: \nHeat olive oil in a soup pot or Dutch oven over medium heat until the oil is shimmering, add the shallots and saute, stirring occasionally, until the shallot is softened and browned around the edges, about 5-7 minutes. \nAdd the tomato paste and 1 1/2 t. thyme. Cook, stirring constantly, until the tomato paste is evenly incorporated into the shallots and is darkened in color, 2-3 minutes. \nAdd the dry sherry, cook, scraping up any browned bits on the bottom of the pot, until the liquid is almost completely cooked out, about a minute. \nAdd the crab stock, plus additional water (or bottled clam juice) to measure 5 cups of liquid total, along with the roasted red pepper and the corn/pulp mixture. Bring to a simmer, simmer for about 10-15 minutes, to blend the flavors.\nWorking in batches, ladle the soup into a blender and puree until smooth. Return the soup to the pot, add the salt and pepper to taste. Bring to a gentle simmer, add the remaining thyme, the remaining 2 c. corn kernels and about 2/3 of the crab meat. Gently simmer for 3-4 minutes. Off heat, stir in lemon juice and parsley, season with salt & pepper to taste. To serve: ladle the soup into bowls, garnish with the remaining crab meat.",

Squeeze in  the juice of half a lemon. Check the seasoning and adjust to taste. You might want more lemon or salt  it all depends on what you have used for the stock.Working in batches or in the pan itself if you have a stick blender, blitz until you have the texture you like. I like mine to still have a few chickpeas and pieces of kale through it so I set aside a couple of ladlefuls and used a stick blender to blitz the rest.\nServe hot, floating a couple of slices of lemon on top of each serving and pass round the parmesan cheese for everyone to help themselves.

If you use a conventional blender or food processor, work in batches. If you find the soup is too thick for you, add some water or stock to thin it to the desired consistency.Stir in the cream, adjust the seasoning and serve.Note: or a more filling meal, you can add brown rice or barley. \nAdd them to your pot after blending the soup and allow to simmer until your rice/barley is cooked through.Find more recipes on my blog htpp://alalemon.com",

Cover and simmer until carrots are almost soft, but take care not to overcook them. Nobody likes a mushy carrot.\n\nAdd tofu. Cover and simmer a few more minutes.\n\nAdd all remaining ingredients (except garnishes). Cover and simmer for just a few more minutes, until beans turn bright green but are still crisp.\n\nGarnish with bell pepper strips and freshly ground black pepper.\nOptional addition: If you really like the coconut flavor and want to take it over the top, add a couple of tablespoons of coconut oil when you put in your tofu. It's amazing!",

Return to the pan and stir in the cream and snipped chives, keep warm while you cook the pancetta. You can make the soup in advance and keep it in a container until it is needed but the pancetta is better cooked fresh just before you need it so it keeps it heat and crispness.\nIn a hot frying pan fry the pancetta. Dont add any additional fat. While the pancetta is cooking some of its fat will cook out, drain this off at intervals as you dont want this running into your creamy soup. When the pancetta is golden and crispy it is ready.\n\nServe the soup in warm bowls, topped with the crispy pancetta and, if you are feeling fancy, with a little sprig of parsley.",

Once the bacon cools, chop very finely.In the same pot over medium heat, add the anchovies, fennel, leek, and garlic to the bacon fat and cook until the onion and fennel are very soft, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir in the coriander and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. \nAdd the roasted cauliflower, broth, bay leaves and 1 cup water. Season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and cook at a high simmer until the cauliflower is very tender, 10 to 15 minutes.Discard the bay leaves and let cool slightly.In a blender or immersion blender, pure the cauliflower mixture until very smooth.Meanwhile, make the chili oil. Wipe out the pot used to make the cauliflower soup. Over very low heat, add the remaining olive oil, paprika, and chili powder and warm until fragrant, about 1 minute.Ladle the delicious soup into bowls and top with bacon bits and chili oil.",

( I had probably around a 1 1/2 c. peels.)\n\nHeat a large Dutch oven over medium heat. \nAdd chopped bacon and cook until crisp, about 10 minutes. \nRemove bacon to a paper towel-lined plate.\nTo the fat in the pan, add the potato skins and cook until crisp about 10 min. (You want to be sure they are crisp, or else they'll just be soggy and greasy, I took mine out at just the 10 minute mark and they weren't truly crisp, so I just spread them out on a cookie sheet and baked them in a 400 degree oven for around 5 minutes and they were very crisp after that.)\n\nRemove the crisped potato skins to the paper-lined plate with the bacon. \nAdd the onion to the fat remaining in the pan, cook until tender and lightly browned, about 6 minutes. \nAdd the thyme and flour, cook and stir for about a minute. Slowly whisk in the chicken broth and the half n half. \nAdd the potatoes and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover and cook until the potatoes are very tender, (you should be able to easly crush a piece of potato against the side of the pot with the back of a wooden spoon) about 10-15 minutes.\nUsing a blender, puree (in small batches) all but about 3 cups of the soup. Using a potato masher or your wooden spoon, lightly crush the potato chunks in the reserved potion of the soup. \nAdd the pureed soup back to the pot and return to a low burner to keep the soup hot. \nAdd in the 2 c. cheese, stir until melted, then add in the sour cream, stir well. Season to taste with salt & pepper. (Sometimes I like to add some of the crisped bacon into the soup mixture at this point, but that's optional.)\nTo serve, top bowls of soup with crisped bacon and potato skins, additional cheddar, sour cream and sliced scallion.",

Cook until potatoes are tender.\n\nMix the cornstarch (the amount is not a typo) with the 3/4 cup water.\nSlowly add enough of the cornstarch/water mixture (you may not have to add it all, do it in small steps) to produce a VERY THICK mixture.  The spoon should practically stand up in this.  It should be the consistency of a very thick pudding.  Stir constantly until the mixture bubbles.\nGRADUALLY add cream, stirring constantly,  to thin the soup out to the desired consistency.  You may have to use MORE cream, depending on the desired thickness.  I like mine thick, like stew, so the 1 cup of cream works well.  Your mileage may vary.\n*\nAdd salt if you feel it needs some.\n\nHeat through (do not boil) and serve with a salad or crusty roll.",

Cook it all for a good 3-4 minutes.\n\nAdd the flour to the pan and stir it in well.\nNext up you'll add in the beer and the broth. \nLet the soup heat up to a gentle boil.\nOnce your broth hits a gentle boil, turn the heat down to low and add in the the half & half and the cheese.\nAllow the cheese to melt completely and then add in the mustard, worcestershire, pepper, and red pepper flakes.\nGrab your immersion blender and smooth out your soup. If you don't have an immersion blender, you can puree batches in a blender. Just make sure you don't fill it more than a third full at a time and cover it tightly so you don't end up with a soupy mess.\n\nAdd a bit of salt to taste and you're ready to enjoy a big ol' bowl of true Wisconsin love.",

Also, wash the chicken parts and dry them with a paper towel.\nPut the chicken parts and the vegetables in a large pot, add bay leaves and half of parsley and dill. Fill the pot with water and bring it to boil. Don't cover.When the soup boils, you'll see fat and foam on top of it. Carefully skim the fat and the foam carefully from top, while trying not to mix the soup. The more foam you skim, the clearer the soup will be.After you finished skimming, lower the heat and cook it the soup for another 30-40 minutes, while checking that there is no more foam on top.Season with salt and pepper.When done, you can strain the soup through a fine colander into another pot or a bowl, or you can just take out all the cooked vegetables and chicken parts.Throw out the cooked onion, celery and herbs. Grate the carrot and put it back in the soup. Chop the other halves of fresh parsley and dill and add it to the soup. Separate the chicken meat from the bones, chop it and add it to the soup.Check the seasoning before serving,\nServe hot!",

To the fat in the pan, add the garlic head, cut-side down, onion, carrot and red pepper flakes. Cook, stirring occasionally until onion is softened, about 5-8 minutes. \nAdd 1 sprig rosemary, broth and beans. Bring to a simmer, reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until the garlic is soft, about 30 minutes, removing the rosemary sprig halfway through cooking.Meanwhile, heat the oven to 400 degrees. In a small bowl combine 3 T. olive oil, chopped rosemary from the other sprig, and minced garlic. \nSpread the bread slices out on a baking sheet and bake for 5 minutes, remove from the oven, flip the slices and brush with the rosemary &amp; garlic oil. Continue baking until the toasts are crisp, 5-10 minutes longer. Set aside while the soup finishes.When the head of garlic is tender, remove it from the soup. When cool enough to handle, squeeze out the cloves and mince fine. \nAdd back to the soup, make sure the soup is at a gentle simmer, add in the spinach and cook until just wilted, just a minute or two. Adjust the seasoning with salt &amp; pepper.\nServe the soup topped with the crisp prosciutto bits and the rosemary-garlic toasts.",

When the squash is ready (it will give when you press on the skin), remove from the oven and cut in half. Scoop out the seeds, remove skin, and discard. \nCut the roasted squash into 2-inch cubes.While the squash is baking, loosely chop the yellow onion and garlic.In a large stock pot over medium heat, melt the ghee. \nAdd the onions and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes. \nAdd the garlic and ginger, stirring to make sure the garlic doesn't burn. Stir in the squash and cook until combined, 3 minutes.Stir in the bone broth, salt, sumac, red chili and cinnamon. Cover and cook for another 10 minutes. \nRemove from the heat.\nTransfer the soup to a blender and blend until smooth. (Optionally, leave half of the soup unblended for a chunkier soup).Return the blended soup to the pot. Turn the heat to low, then stir in water, coconut milk, and apple cider vinegar. Cook for another minute or two until warmed through. \nAdd salt and black pepper, to taste. \nServe.",

Cook over medium low heat until translucent.  \nAdd the garlic and saute until fragrant.   \nAdd the tomato paste and harissa.  Cook a minute then add the water or stock slowly while stirring to combine the flavor paste in the pot with the liquids.  Throw in the chickpeas and bring to a boil.  As soon as it reaches a boil, reduce heat to a simmer.\n\nAdd the pasta and cook according to the package directions.  My suggestion is that if you are using fresh pasta, give it a rinse under tap water to remove the starch before adding it to the soup.  It might make the broth cloudy.  If using rice noodles add them right before serving to prevent overcooked mushy noodles.  To cook rice noodles place them in a shallow dish and cover with hot water for 10-15 minutes to soften.\nJust before serving taste for seasoning, adjust to your taste.  \nAdding too much salt earlier on could make things too salty because some of the ingredients can bring a lot of salt to the pot.  Then add the spinach, it will only take a minute to shrink into nearly nothing, but it is sure a powerhouse vegetable that amps up the nutrition in this meal quickly and without fuss.  A squeeze of fresh lemon juice after it has been taken off the heat will add a nice bright flavor to perk up those dreary dark days of winter.  Enjoy with some crusty bread.  A meal you can feel good about, filling yet light.",

The rest of the broccoli will be pureed.\nIn your soup pot, saute over med-high heat: 2 Tbsp of your olive oil with the shallot, onion and jalapeno. When cooked lightly, add in lemon juice, veggie broth, remaining oil, cheddar cheese, salt and pepper. Reduce heat to medium.\n\nBake your potatoes using an oven or microwave. Rough chop them and add them to your pot.\n\nAdd in the broccoli. Remember to leave out a few florets for later use though.\nCover with lid, when broccoli is tender, turn heat off.\n\nTransfer contents of pot into a large mixing bowl. Allow to cool slightly. \nAdd to the bowl the fresh parsley, soy creamer, vegenaise and soy milk. Fold new ingredients into the hot soup mixture.\nIn batches, puree the soup in a Vitamix or other food-processor style blender. Soup should be smooth-no lumps or chunks. Warning: only blend warm soup in blender with extreme caution! Never aim blender toward your face and always start on the lowest setting possible. Never overfill the blender.\nIn the soup pot, add the broccoli florets, a dash of veggie broth and saute covered for about a minute until tender.\n\nAdd the pureed soup back into the soup pot. \nAdd a bay leaf and a few pinches of chopped basil (optional).\nSimmer uncovered for at least twenty minutes to cook out all the air bubbles. Stir constantly for the first few minutes. \nRemove the bay leaf before serving or storing.\n\nServe with a garnish of 1 tsp soy creamer drops, a pinch of fresh parsley, a basil leaf and of course some shreds of cheddar cheese.\nLower Fat Modifications: Use half the amount of olive oil, and substitute the creamer for more soy milk.\nYou can also use less cheese, but now why would you want to do that? :)",

Bring to a boil, then cook over medium heat for about 20 minutes, or until lentils are soft.\n\nAdd the masala, curry and chili flakes half way and mix well.\n\nServe with fresh parsley for garnish, with some freshly ground black pepper, and a small wedge of lemon. It really kicks it up a notch (unfortunately I didn't get the lemon when I made this, boo!)\nI put this soup into individual microwavable containers for lunch, and before taking them to work, I would add a bit of chicken broth, because it thickens up quite a lot",

Brown your beef well on all sides.\nOnce all sides are browned, drain off any excess fat in pan (more than a tsp.) and add 1 qt. of stock to pot.  Bring to boil, then reduce to simmer.  Cover pan and simmer gently for until meat is fork tender, ~2 1/2 hours.\nWhen beef is finished, transfer it to a large bowl with any juices and let cool until able to handle, then shred it.\nIn the same pot you cooked the beef in, add the bacon and cook just done.  \nRemove bacon, but leave fat in pan.\n\nAdd veggies and cook until just beginning to soften.\n\nAdd shredded beef and reserved bacon back to pot along with herbs.\n\nAdd 2 qts. stock (or more to just cover) and simmer over medium-low heat until vegetables are tender, ~10 minutes or so.\nI let it sit, covered for at least an hour to allow the flavors to come together.  \nRemove herb stems and bay leaves.  Season with freshly cracked black pepper (and salt if needed, depends on the saltiness of the liquid you used, so taste first).\nTo serve, drizzle with a glug of balsamic vinegar and grate some fresh parmesan over the top.  \nSprinkle with fresh, chopped herbs and more black pepper, if desired.",

Just add in with carrots and let simmer for approximately 30 minutes instead of 15 minutes).\nOnce lentils are heated through, blend soup until smooth. This can be done with with either an emulsifier right in the pot or by putting the soup in batches into a blender.\nStir in the lemon juice and cilantro. Season with salt to taste. Enjoy!",
