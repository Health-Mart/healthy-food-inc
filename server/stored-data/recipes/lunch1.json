Then add meat, salt and pepper to taste, and rice and mix until combined being careful not to overwork the meat blend so it doesn't get too dense and will stay tender during cooking. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Next, add a bit of sauce, just enough to cover the bottom of a 9\" x 13\" baking pan as you will need the rest to cover the rolls when you are finished. Now take 1 leaf, bottom (vein) side up, and place about 1/4 cup of meat into the bottom 3/4 of the leaf and roll it up tucking in the sides to secure the meat similar to rolling a burrito.  If the leaves are too small to tuck in the edges, as was the case with mine, no bother, I left them open and it turned out equally as fine with half the work. Repeat until all the meat and leaves have been used. If you have extras of either, I tuck the meat in between the rows and/or layer the extra leaves on top of the other cabbage rolls and then top with the tomato sauce and petite diced tomatoes.

Before serving, warm the satay sauce in the microwave oven, covered slightly, for approximately 1.5 to 2mins.When you are ready to grill the chicken, start forming satays by piercing the chicken through the bamboo skewers. I find it alot easier to pierce the meat into the sticks when they are long strips and I pierce through in an undulating manner.  Set aside until ready to use.Preheat your oven to 200 deg Celsius at GRILL. \nPlace your oven shelf higher and closer to the top too.\nLay the satay sticks on a cooling mesh sitting over a flat baking sheet to collect drippings.\nPlace the tray of satay under the grill. And grill for 10 to 20 mins. It really depends on how thick your chicken sticks are.\nRemove the tray from the oven when one side of the satay is a golden brown (not dark brown!). Turn over the satay to the other side. And continue to grill till it has a nice dark golden brown. I like it a little burnt.\nServe warm with satay sauce and sliced cucumber.","ingredients":[{"id":16097,"name":"crunchy peanut butter","localizedName":"crunchy peanut butter","image":"peanut-butter.png"},{"id":1002013,"name":"ground coriander","localizedName":"ground coriander","image":"ground-coriander.jpg"},{"id":2043,"name":"turmeric","localizedName":"turmeric","image":"turmeric.jpg"},{"id":0,"name":"dark soy sauce","localizedName":"dark soy sauce","image":"soy-sauce.jpg"},{"id":2009,"name":"chili powder","localizedName":"chili powder","image":"chili-powder.jpg"},{"id":12115,"name":"coconut cream","localizedName":"coconut cream","image":"coconut-cream.jpg"},{"id":4513,"name":"vegetable oil","localizedName":"vegetable oil","image":"vegetable-oil.jpg"},{"id":1012014,"name":"ground cumin","localizedName":"ground cumin","image":"ground-cumin.jpg"},{"id":11206,"name":"cucumber","localizedName":"cucumber","image":"cucumber.jpg"},{"id":0,"name":"marinade","localizedName":"marinade","image":"seasoning.png"},{"id":5006,"name":"whole chicken","localizedName":"whole chicken","image":"whole-chicken.jpg"},{"id":16091,"name":"peanuts","localizedName":"peanuts","image":"peanuts.png"},{"id":0,"name":"sauce","localizedName":"sauce","image":""},{"id":19335,"name":"sugar","localizedName":"sugar","image":"sugar-in-bowl.png"},{"id":14412,"name":"water","localizedName":"water","image":"water.png"},{"id":1065062,"name":"meat","localizedName":"meat","image":"whole-chicken.jpg"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","localizedName":"salt","image":"salt.jpg"},{"id":10018364,"name":"wrap","localizedName":"wrap","image":"flour-tortilla.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404727,"name":"baking sheet","localizedName":"baking sheet","image":"baking-sheet.jpg"},{"id":404762,"name":"microwave","localizedName":"microwave","image":"microwave.jpg"},{"id":3065,"name":"skewers","localizedName":"skewers","image":"wooden-skewers.jpg"},{"id":404706,"name":"grill","localizedName":"grill","image":"grill.jpg"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","localizedName":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"},{"id":404784,"name":"oven","localizedName":"oven","image":"oven.jpg"}],"length":{"number":372,"unit":"minutes"}}]}],"spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/chicken-satay-638308"},{"vegetarian":false,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":true,"dairyFree":false,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":false,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":20,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"aggregateLikes":1,"spoonacularScore":58.0,"healthScore":20.0,"creditsText":"Foodista.com – The Cooking Encyclopedia Everyone Can Edit","license":"CC BY 3.0","sourceName":"Foodista","pricePerServing":254.87,"id":634404,"title":"Basic Risotto","readyInMinutes":45,"servings":2,"sourceUrl":"https://www.foodista.com/recipe/HQMJRX88/basic-risotto","image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/634404-312x231.jpg","imageType":"jpg","summary":"Basic Risotto is a main course that serves 2.
