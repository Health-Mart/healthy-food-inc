Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer for an hour, the liquid should be reduced by at least half. Strain the stock, using a fine-mesh strainer, discarding solids (you should have 3-4 c. of stock) season lightly with salt to taste. *You can do this step a day ahead of time, and keep the stock in the refrigerator until ready to use, any longer and I would suggest freezing the stock. Also if you do this, you'll also want to freeze the crab meat as well, my preferred way to freeze crab meat is by placing the meat in a ziplock freezer bag and adding a few tablespoons of milk.\n\nCut the kernels from the ears of corn into a large bowl (you should have around 3 c. corn). Using the back of a chef's knife, scrape the spent cobs to extract the sweet, milky corn pulp into a separate bowl. \nAdd a cup of the corn kernels into the bowl with the corn pulp and reserve the remaining corn kernels.\nTo make the soup: \nHeat olive oil in a soup pot or Dutch oven over medium heat until the oil is shimmering, add the shallots and saute, stirring occasionally, until the shallot is softened and browned around the edges, about 5-7 minutes. \nAdd the tomato paste and 1 1/2 t. thyme. Cook, stirring constantly, until the tomato paste is evenly incorporated into the shallots and is darkened in color, 2-3 minutes. \nAdd the dry sherry, cook, scraping up any browned bits on the bottom of the pot, until the liquid is almost completely cooked out, about a minute. \nAdd the crab stock, plus additional water (or bottled clam juice) to measure 5 cups of liquid total, along with the roasted red pepper and the corn/pulp mixture. Bring to a simmer, simmer for about 10-15 minutes, to blend the flavors.\nWorking in batches, ladle the soup into a blender and puree until smooth. Return the soup to the pot, add the salt and pepper to taste. Bring to a gentle simmer, add the remaining thyme, the remaining 2 c. corn kernels and about 2/3 of the crab meat. Gently simmer for 3-4 minutes. Off heat, stir in lemon juice and parsley, season with salt & pepper to taste.

Once the leeks are cooked through and softened, add the artichoke hearts, tarragon, and salt. Cook until the artichoke hearts are warmed through, then remove from pan to a bowl and set aside.2 In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs and the cottage cheese. In a small bowl, whisk together the flour, Parmesan, and baking powder. \nAdd the flour mixture to the egg mixture and whisk. Stir the artichokes and leeks into the egg mixture. Note that the color of the mixture may change, don't worry if this happens, it will go back to normal when cooked. 3 Wipe out the pan with a paper towel. Then melt another tablespoon of butter into the pan on medium heat, and swirl along the bottom and sides to coat well. \nPour the egg mixture into the pan, swirling to make sure the artichokes and leeks are evenly distributed. Lower the heat. Cover the pan, slowly cook on the stove top for 12 to 15 minutes, until all but the center has set. You'll need to check every few minutes. The heat should be high enough to set the mixture, but low enough so that the edges don't brown. This frittata benefits from slow, gentle cooking. 4 \nPlace rack in upper third of oven. Preheat the broiler. When the frittata is mostly set, except for the center which is still wiggly, place the pan in the oven.
