Take one mug and heat it up in the microwave for a few seconds (the milk can't be too cold or too hot,  lukewarm is the right temperature). \nAdd fresh yeast and a tablespoon of sugar. \nMix. In the second mug, mix the milk with one egg until well combined. Set both mugs aside for later.Sift the flour in a large bowl. \nAdd caster sugar, salt, ground mixed spice and mix until well combined. \nPour in the content of both mugs (make sure the fresh yeast has formed a foam  if not, then wait a bit longer). Now using a wooden spoon combine all the ingredients. \nTransfer onto a floured surface and knead for 5 minutes to get elastic dough.Grease the same bowl with some oil and place the dough in. Cover with a clean kitchen towel and let it rise in a warm place for 1 hour.Once the dough has risen, transfer it onto the floured surface and using your fist, knock it down. Now add dried fruit in the middle of the dough and start bringing the edges towards the middle (like if you wanted to cover the fruits). Start kneading slowly and knead until the fruits have moved around and you see them coming out (You should be able to see or feel that the fruit is spread throughout the dough).When ready, stretch and flatten the dough (use a rolling pin, if needed). Using a cookie cutter cut out about 15 -18 pieces. \nRoll them into balls. If you end up with cut offs simply form balls out of them.\nPlace on a baking tray lined with baking paper and cover with a kitchen towel. \nLet them rise for 1 hour.Once risen, you can either make crosses with flour (and water) or wait until they are cooked and use icing sugar (and water) instead. In both cases the mixtures should be quite thick but still easy to pipe (always use less water than flour/sugar).\nBake them in a preheated oven at 200C / 400F for 15 minutes or until baked through.\nServe cold, warm or toasted with butter &amp; jam!Enjoy!","ingredients":[{"id":0,"name":"caster sugar","localizedName":"caster sugar","image":"sugar-in-bowl.png"},{"id":1009094,"name":"dried fruit","localizedName":"dried fruit","image":"dried-fruit-mixed.jpg"},{"id":18374,"name":"fresh yeast","localizedName":"fresh yeast","image":"yeast-fresh.jpg"},{"id":19336,"name":"powdered sugar","localizedName":"powdered sugar","image":"powdered-sugar.jpg"},{"id":1022035,"name":"mixed spice","localizedName":"mixed spice","image":"ground-coriander.jpg"},{"id":1001,"name":"butter","localizedName":"butter","image":"butter-sliced.jpg"},{"id":10118192,"name":"cookies","localizedName":"cookies","image":"shortbread-cookies.jpg"},{"id":9431,"name":"fruit","localizedName":"fruit","image":"mixed-fresh-fruit.jpg"},{"id":0,"name":"spread","localizedName":"spread","image":""},{"id":0,"name":"dough","localizedName":"dough","image":"pizza-dough"},{"id":20081,"name":"all purpose flour","localizedName":"all purpose flour","image":"flour.png"},{"id":19335,"name":"sugar","localizedName":"sugar","image":"sugar-in-bowl.png"},{"id":14412,"name":"water","localizedName":"water","image":"water.png"},{"id":1077,"name":"milk","localizedName":"milk","image":"milk.png"},{"id":0,"name":"roll","localizedName":"roll","image":"dinner-yeast-rolls.jpg"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","localizedName":"salt","image":"salt.jpg"},{"id":1123,"name":"egg","localizedName":"egg","image":"egg.png"},{"id":19297,"name":"jam","localizedName":"jam","image":"strawberry-jam.png"},{"id":4582,"name":"cooking oil","localizedName":"cooking oil","image":"vegetable-oil.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":221429,"name":"cookie cutter","localizedName":"cookie cutter","image":"cookie-cutters.jpg"},{"id":221439,"name":"kitchen towels","localizedName":"kitchen towels","image":"dish-towel.jpg"},{"id":404770,"name":"baking paper","localizedName":"baking paper","image":"baking-paper.jpg"},{"id":404732,"name":"wooden spoon","localizedName":"wooden spoon","image":"wooden-spoon.jpg"},{"id":404646,"name":"baking pan","localizedName":"baking pan","image":"roasting-pan.jpg"},{"id":404746,"name":"rolling pin","localizedName":"rolling pin","image":"rolling-pin.jpg"},{"id":404762,"name":"microwave","localizedName":"microwave","image":"microwave.jpg"},{"id":404784,"name":"oven","localizedName":"oven","image":"oven.jpg"},{"id":404784,"name":"oven","localizedName":"oven","image":"oven.jpg","temperature":{"number":200.0,"unit":"Celsius"}},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","localizedName":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"}],"length":{"number":140,"unit":"minutes"}}]}],"spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/hot-cross-buns-1095835"},{"vegetarian":false,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":true,"dairyFree":false,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":false,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":7,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":true,"preparationMinutes":10,"cookingMinutes":10,"aggregateLikes":0,"spoonacularScore":5.0,"healthScore":0.0,"creditsText":"Jen West","sourceName":"Pink When","pricePerServing":35.02,"id":1499853,"title":"Cake Mix Donuts","readyInMinutes":20,"servings":8,"sourceUrl":"https://www.pinkwhen.com/cake-mix-donuts/","image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/1499853-312x231.jpg","imageType":"jpg","summary":"Cake Mix Donuts is a <b>gluten free and fodmap friendly</b> recipe with 8 servings.

Do NOT boil.\nSet the mixture aside to cool till lukewarm. About 38 deg C. Check with your finger right into the mixture. If its hot, then cool some more. I should be just very mildly comfortably warm to the touch.\nWhen the mixture is lukewarm, add 2 packets of instant dry yeast (about 16g, 4.5 teaspoons). \nSprinkle the yeast on the surface of the mixture. Leave it for 3 to 5 minutes. If the yeast is fresh and alive, you will see it growing and poofing up.\n\nAdd 8 C of plain flour. \nMix it all up together.

The dough may be easier to manage when left to rise this way instead as it will be colder and harder.\nAfter the mentioned time, the dough would have risen again. Punch it down.\nKnead the dough for a few moments and then transfer the dough to the working table that has been lightly floured.\nIf the dough is too wet at this stage. Chill it in the fridge for a while. Itll help.\nFlour a rolling pin. And roll out the dough into a huge long rectangle.\n\nCut the dough into 2 parts. So that there are two long pieces of dough.\n\nPour 2 cups of melted butter onto the rolled out dough.\nNote: Check your dough. If its VERY wet, reduce the amount of melted butter added at this stage. When the rolls are laid out in the pan later, pour the rest of the melted butter on them instead. I really prefer to add all the melted butter at this stage because the flavour goes right into the dough.\nUsing fingers, evenly distribute the butter.\n\nSprinkle 1/4 cup of cinnamon over the dough.\n\nSprinkle 1 cup of castor sugar over the dough.\n\nSprinkle 1 cup of brown sugar over the dough. As brown sugar gets clumpy. I scattered the sugar on the dough with my fingers.\nChop some pecan nuts to get about 2 cups worth of chopped pecans.\n\nSprinkle the chopped pecan nuts onto the rolled dough.\n\nRoll up the dough, lengthwise. It will be a really long roll.
